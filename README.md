# C++ OOP Final Project - NaUKMA

This repository contains my final project for the C++ Object-Oriented Programming course at the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy (NaUKMA).

## Task Description

1. Implement **Date and Time** classes with validation support, getters/setters, day of the week determination, increment/decrement operations, arithmetic operations (+, -, +=, -=), comparison operators, and output utilities. Ensure constructors and state invariance.

2. Create an **Event** class containing date, time, type, priority, title, and event description. Support events with and without time, provide field access, formatted output, and comparison by date and time.

3. Implement a **Calendar** class with the ability to display a specific month (or year), navigate between months, highlight current and important dates, integrate with **Event** objects, and filter events by type, priority, month/specific period, and more.

4. Given the duration of a semester in weeks, calculate its end date based on duration and start date.

5. Using the calendar, display on which day of the week your birthday fell, as well as birthdays of famous figures in science and culture (of your choice).

6. Define a **Screen** class to display a fragment of text on the screen, starting from a certain position. Implement scrolling of text forward and backward. Text for display, consisting of n paragraphs with m sentences each, can be created with the =lorem(n,m) command in Microsoft Word and saved in a text file. Use std::ifstream to read text from the file.

7. Provide copying and moving of screens. Implement text editing in the screen.

8. Develop a **Dictionary** class that builds a dictionary from text: sorts words lexicographically or by frequency of occurrence, and allows tracking foreign words with specified statuses (e.g., *new*, *in the process of learning*, *learned*, *ignored*, etc.). Implement operations for dictionary supplementation and finding their union, intersection, output utility (and other useful components at your discretion).

9. Build an inheritance of the bidirectional queue interface **Deque<T>** (**T** arbitrary type) using an array-based queue and a list-based queue. Apply **NVI** (Non-Virtual Interface).

10. Build an implementation inheritance of the bidirectional queue **Deque<T, Implementation>** using an array-based queue **ArrayDeque<T>** and a list-based queue **ListDeque<T>**. Compare the application of private inheritance and aggregation.

## Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of all components listed in the task description, following object-oriented programming principles and best practices in C++.

## Current Evaluation: TBD (39/40)
